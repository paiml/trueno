    status: completed
    type: feature
    priority: high
    description: |
      Implement AVX-512 SIMD acceleration for max() and min() reduction operations.
      Achieved: 8-12x speedup over scalar baseline.

  - id: avx512-argmax-argmin
    title: "Implement AVX-512 argmax/argmin with 3.2-3.3x speedup (Phase 5)"
    status: completed
    type: feature
    priority: high
    description: |
      Implement AVX-512 SIMD acceleration for argmax() and argmin() index-finding operations.
      Target: ≥8x speedup over scalar baseline for compute-bound reductions.

      Implementation strategy:
      - 16-way parallel comparison with index tracking
      - Horizontal reduction to find max/min value and its index
      - Scalar scan for exact index verification

      Testing:
      - 10 tests (5 argmax, 5 argmin)
      - Target: 817 total tests passing

      Performance validation:
      - Benchmark argmax/argmin at sizes 1000, 10000
      - Target: 8x+ speedup vs scalar baseline

    type: release
    priority: medium
    description: |
      Release Trueno v0.3.0 with complete AVX-512 backend support.

      Completed:
      - 5 phases of AVX-512 implementation (add, dot, sum, max/min, argmax/argmin)
      - 819 tests passing
      - TDG score 92.4/100 (A)
      - Version 0.3.0 released with git tag
      - Pushed to GitHub

  - id: avx512-sub-mul-div
    title: "Implement AVX-512 sub/mul/div (optional - memory-bound)"
    status: todo
    type: feature
    priority: low
    description: |
      Implement AVX-512 versions of sub(), mul(), div() element-wise operations.

      Note: These are memory-bound operations (~1x speedup like add()).
      Low priority since they won't achieve 8x target.

      Implementation: 16-way SIMD with _mm512_sub_ps, _mm512_mul_ps, _mm512_div_ps

    type: feature
    priority: high
    description: |
      Implement AVX-512 L2 norm: sqrt(sum(x^2))

      Completed:
      - AVX-512 SIMD implementation with 16-way parallel multiply-add
      - Achieved 6-9x speedup (9.3x at size 1000, 6.2x at size 10000)
      - Added 8 comprehensive tests (basic, empty, single, aligned, non-aligned, large, equivalence, negative)
      - 827 tests passing
      - Added AVX-512 benchmark configuration
