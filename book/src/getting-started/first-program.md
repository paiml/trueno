# First Program

Let's build a complete image processing program using Trueno to demonstrate real-world usage.

## Project: Brightness Adjustment Tool

We'll create a CLI tool that adjusts image brightness using SIMD-accelerated vector operations.

[Content to be added: Complete example with image loading, vector processing, benchmarking]
