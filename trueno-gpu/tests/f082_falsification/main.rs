//! F082 Falsification Tests
//!
//! These tests apply Popperian falsification to the F082 hypothesis:
//! "Computed Address From Loaded Value causes crash when ld.shared value
//! is used to compute address for st.global"
//!
//! Alternative Hypothesis: The bug is in 32->64 bit conversion during
//! address computation, not the dependency chain itself.
